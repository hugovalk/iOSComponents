HVNumericTextFieldWithButton

This component is a textfield that can be used to input integer numbers. The corresponding keyboard is the standard numeric keyboard, except an extra 'Done' button is located in the lower left corner.

This makes it easy for the user to dismiss the keyboard. 

It can be used by including the files (not the .pxm files) in this folder into your project. Then you can use HVNumericTextFieldWithButton instead of a normal UITextField. An example is included where the textfield is configured in a IB file. 

You can set the specific text of the 'Done' button by using the 
- (void)setTitleText:(NSString *)title
method on HVNumericTextFieldWithButton. 

The delegate that comes with this component is configured by the textfield itself and does not need to be modified.
